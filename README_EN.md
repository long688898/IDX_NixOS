## Project Overview
This project is a multi-container proxy service deployment solution based on the IDX development environment. It integrates various network tools and services, including Sing-Box, Cloudflare Argo Tunnel, FRP intranet penetration, and multiple Linux container environments. The project uses Nix configuration files for automated deployment and management, providing a complete network proxy and remote access solution.

## Features
1. Multi-Container Environment : Simultaneously deploy Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and Alpine Linux containers
2. Network Proxy Service : Integrate Sing-Box with VMess and VLESS protocol support
3. Network Tunneling : Enable external access to internal services via Cloudflare Argo Tunnel and FRP
4. Service Monitoring : Integrate Nezha monitoring agent for real-time service status tracking
5. Automated Deployment : One-click deployment and startup using IDX's Nix configuration
6. Secure Access : All containers configured with SSH remote access, supporting password authentication

## Component Details
### 1. Container Environment
The project deploys four mainstream Linux containers, each configured with SSH service for remote login:

- Debian: General Linux environment suitable for most application deployments.
- Ubuntu: User-friendly interface with rich package support.
- CentOS 9: Enterprise-grade stability for long-running services.
- Alpine: Lightweight container with minimal resource usage.

### 2. Network Proxy Service
Using Sing-Box to provide high-performance network proxy services:

- Protocol Support: VMess and VLESS.
- Transport Method: WebSocket + TLS.
- Multi-Client Support: Auto-generate configurations for Clash, V2rayN, NekoBox, Shadowrocket, and SingBox.

### 3. Network Tunneling Service
- Cloudflare Argo Tunnel: Securely expose internal services to the internet without public IP.
- FRP Intranet Penetration: Provide external access ports for each container's SSH service.

### 4. Monitoring Service
- Nezha Monitoring: Real-time server status monitoring, including CPU, memory, network metrics.

## Deployment Steps
1. Download Project
   
   - Download the project archive file locally.

2. Modify Configuration
   
   - Open .idx/dev.nix file.
   - Modify parameters according to comments.
   - Important: Beginners should maintain default settings except for the env section.

3. Save Files
   
   - Save the modified .idx/dev.nix file.
   - Ensure all necessary files are included in the archive.

4. Deploy to IDX
   
   - Visit https://idx.google.com.
   - Create new custom workspace.
   - Upload the modified project archive.
   - Wait approximately 2 minutes for automatic deployment.

5. Verify Deployment
   
   - Access services through configured domain.
   - Access containers using configured ports and passwords.
   - Check Nezha dashboard for service status.

Notes:

- Ensure parameter formats are correct and quotes are complete.
- Use strong passwords for sensitive information.
- Test all services immediately after deployment.
